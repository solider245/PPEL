# Python Practical Examples List
REAL projects for beginner/intermediate programmers.

## What is this?


This is a list of projects meant for beginners to learn Python and Git with!

Being a beginner myself, I find that there aren't many good examples or projects out there that are easy to contribute to. If you take a look at the [awesome-for-beginners](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners) list, you'll find that these are pretty large and complex projects.

The projects here are much smaller, but also **practical**. These projects are no [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook), but they are also no **for i in range(10): print(i)**
    
You will learn useful things, like:
* Reading and writing to files
* List comprehensions
* Regular expressions
* How to use modules of the Standard Library
* ...and much more!

... all of which are useful in programming in general, not just Python! (Except list comprehensions maybe...)

## Sounds great! How do I get started?

#### If you are a beginner/contributor:

Go to one of the projects' pages, and follow the instructions there! Add new features! Submit and/or fix bugs! Ask questions! Get help with any of these! Have fun! :)

For more information on which tags to use when opening issues, etc., check out the [Beginners' Guide](https://github.com/doczi-dominik/PPEL/blob/master/BEGINNERS_GUIDE.md) (not the game).

#### If you are more experienced/a developer:

The above applies to you, too! But of course, you may have more experience with Python. In that case, try to improve the documentation/comments, help make the program more optimized, and most importantly, help the beginners!

For more information on how to make a good PPEL project, please consult the [Developers' Guide](https://github.com/doczi-dominik/PPEL/blob/master/DEVELOPERS_GUIDE.md).

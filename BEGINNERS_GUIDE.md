# Beginners' Guide to Contribution

So, you've decided that you want to try Git(Hub) and contribute to a simple Python project. That's great! This guide here will provide you with the necessary information to do so!

## Prerequisites

When contribution to these projects, some previous knowledge and/or software is required. Here you will find these requirements, and some helpful links to help you satisfy them!

- The first one should be obvious: **Python!**
You will need Python installed on your computer. Python 2.7 is nearing it's End of Life date, an it will not be maintained in [less than a year](https://pythonclock.org/) (at the time of writing), so I urge project maintainers to use Python 3.7 or higher.

Besides having Python 3 installed, you should have some *knowledge* about Python. The programs listed here a simple, but they are not on par with the two lines of code most sites provide in terms of simplicity. These should be **real programs**. Their simple nature comes from great documentation and trying to mostly use only the Python Standard Library. To a complete beginner, such a project may still feel overwhelming. In that case, feel free to ask for help about parts of the programs you don't understand.

- You should have some knowledge about Git/GitHub.
This is not necessary per se if you only want to clone the project, then explore it on your own with no intention of submitting it anywhere, but Git is a very useful tool, which you will no doubt encounter in the future as a programmer.

I recommend checking out https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions . It's an "interactive tour", which will walk you through how to fork a repository, modify the files, then publish the changes. 

If you finished it, or you already have experince with Git, feel free to add yourself to the Contributors list. :)

## Labels

When creating an issue, here's what labels you should use or look for.

**feature-request** - You should tag your issue with this if you want to extend the program or improve one of it's features.

**bug-report** - If you find any bug or otherwise undocumented behaviour, please use this label.

**difficulty: [easy-medium-expert]** - Use this label to filter issues by your own ablity. There are no *hard-coded* difficulty levels, so try a few words that come to mind.
